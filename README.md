## Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Vida — a full stack developer skilled in modern web technologies, backend development, and databases.

- 🎒 Graduated in 2024, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computing.
- 💻 I’m currently building my frontend skills.
- 🚀 I’m currently working on my personal website <a href = "https://vvidaarsic.netlify.app">vvidaarsic.netlify.app</a>. It's built using React, Next.js and Tailwind. Take a look, and give honest feedback. I really glad to hear it.
